Additional Considerations:

* Type of Cereal: Whole grain cereals are a better choice than refined cereals, as they contain more fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
* Sugar Content: Check the nutrition label to compare sugar content between different brands. Opt for cereals with less added sugar.
* Serving Size: Pay attention to the recommended serving size on the box. Eating larger portions can quickly increase the calorie, sugar, and sodium intake.

Remember:  Cereal can be a healthy breakfast option when you choose whole grain varieties and control portion sizes.
